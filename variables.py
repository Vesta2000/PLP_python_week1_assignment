#Rules for Naming Python Variables
#Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). For example:
#snake_case, MACRO_CASE, camelCase, CapsWords
#Python is case-sensitive. So num and Num are different variables
num = 55
Num = 510
print(num)
print(Num)

#Avoid using keywords like if, True, class, etc. as variable names
